## 🌿 **Branch Strategy**
- `main` - Production ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for completed features  
- `feature/frontend-foundation` - Developer A working branch
- `feature/backend-platform` - Developer B working branch

## 👥 **Developer Assignments**

### 👨‍💻 **Developer A - Frontend Specialist**
**Technologies**: React, TypeScript, D3.js, TailwindCSS, Next.js
**Primary Agents**: `senior-fullstack-python-engineer`, `tdd-expert`, `complexity-eradicator`
**Phases**: Frontend foundation → Visualization engine → Dashboard implementation → Advanced UI features
**Branch**: `feature/frontend-foundation`

### 🔧 **Developer B - Backend/Data Specialist**  
**Technologies**: FastAPI, Python, Databricks, PySpark, Azure, PostgreSQL
**Primary Agents**: `databricks-platform-architect`, `etl-pipeline-engineer`, `sql-migration-specialist`, `data-modeling-expert`
**Phases**: Backend APIs → Databricks architecture → Manager hierarchy → Gold layer → Performance optimization
**Branch**: `feature/backend-platform`

## 📋 **Key Coordination Documents**

1. **[Parallel Development Guide](docs/coordination/PARALLEL_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md)** - Workflow and communication protocols
2. **[API Specification](docs/api-contracts/API_SPECIFICATION.md)** - Complete API contracts for parallel development
3. **[Developer A Phases](docs/coordination/DEVELOPER_A_PHASES.md)** - Frontend development roadmap  
4. **[Developer B Phases](docs/coordination/DEVELOPER_B_PHASES.md)** - Backend/data development roadmap
5. **[Integration Schedule](docs/coordination/INTEGRATION_SCHEDULE.md)** - Weekly sync points and milestones

## 🔗 **Critical Integration Points**

- **Week 4**: API contract finalization
- **Week 8**: Authentication system integration  
- **Week 12**: First dashboard with real data
- **Week 16**: Full platform integration
- **Week 20**: Production deployment readiness

## 🎯 **Getting Started**

### **Developer A - Frontend Setup:**
```bash
git checkout feature/frontend-foundation
cd frontend/
# Begin React application development
# Reference: frontend/README.md
```

### **Developer B - Backend Setup:**  
```bash
git checkout feature/backend-platform  
cd backend/
# Begin FastAPI development
# Reference: backend/README.md
```

## 📊 **Success Metrics**
- **Performance**: <2 second dashboard load times
- **Scalability**: 500+ customers supported  
- **Quality**: 90%+ test coverage
- **Integration**: Weekly milestone completions
- **Customer Isolation**: 100% data separation

## 🛡️ **Quality Gates**
- All tests passing before merge to `develop`
- API contracts validated
- Customer data isolation verified
- Performance benchmarks met
- Code review completed

## 🔄 **Daily Workflow**
1. Pull latest from `develop` branch
2. Work on assigned features in dedicated branches
3. Create PRs to `develop` for completed features  
4. Coordinate via GitHub issues and PR comments
5. Sync progress in coordination documents

## 📞 **Communication**
- **GitHub Issues**: Technical problems and feature requests
- **PR Comments**: Code-specific discussions
- **Coordination Docs**: Status updates and blocking issues
- **Weekly Syncs**: Monday planning, Wednesday integration, Friday review
