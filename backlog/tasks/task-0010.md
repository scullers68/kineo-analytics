- [x] TypeScript interfaces and types defined for all chart components
- [x] Responsive scaling system working across desktop, tablet, mobile breakpoints
- [x] Animation framework implemented with configurable timing and easing
- [x] Theme integration with light/dark mode support from existing Zustand store
- [x] Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA) with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- [x] Performance optimization for large datasets (10K+ data points per customer)
- [x] Component library structure with Storybook documentation
- [x] Unit tests achieving 90%+ coverage for all chart components
- [x] Integration tests with existing dashboard framework components

## Implementation Notes
**Technical Architecture**:
- Use React useRef and useEffect hooks for D3.js integration

## Implementation Plan (TDD Approach)

### Phase 1: Test-Driven Foundation (RED Phase Established) ✅
**Objective**: Establish comprehensive failing tests that define the expected API and behavior for the D3.js chart component library.

**Completed Work**:
- **Frontend Architecture Analysis**: Reviewed existing React/TypeScript setup, identified Next.js 14+, D3.js v7.8.0 already installed, Zustand theme store, TailwindCSS design system, and Vitest testing framework with TDD Guard enabled
- **TypeScript Interface Design**: Defined comprehensive type system for chart components in `/frontend/src/types/store.ts` including `ChartDataPoint`, `ChartDataset`, `ChartDimensions`, `ChartTheme`, `AnimationConfig`, `AccessibilityConfig`, `PerformanceConfig`, and `ChartInstance`
- **Failing Tests Created**: Established RED phase with comprehensive test suite in `/tests/charts/`:
  - `base-chart-simple.test.ts`: 10 failing tests for core component architecture
  - `responsive-scaling.test.ts`: Tests for mobile/tablet/desktop breakpoint handling
  - `animation-framework.test.ts`: Tests for configurable animations with easing and staggering
  - `accessibility-compliance.test.ts`: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance tests including keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, screen reader support
  - `performance-optimization.test.ts`: Tests for 10K+ data point handling, virtualization, web worker integration

**Test Results**: All tests properly failing with "Cannot find module" errors, establishing clear RED phase for TDD implementation.

**TDD Guard Compliance**: Working correctly - tests fail because implementation doesn't exist, preventing premature implementation.
