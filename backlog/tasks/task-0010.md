# EPIC - D3.js Chart Component Library Foundation

## Description
Create a comprehensive, reusable D3.js chart component library integrated with React/TypeScript that supports the Kineo Analytics multi-tenant SaaS platform. This library must handle 500+ customers with <2 second load times, providing responsive, interactive charts with consistent theming and accessibility standards.

**Business Value**: Enables rich data visualization across all customer dashboards, supporting learning analytics insights for course completions, certifications, and manager hierarchies. Critical foundation for Phase 2 visualization engine.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Base chart component architecture with D3.js + React integration established
- [ ] TypeScript interfaces and types defined for all chart components
- [ ] Responsive scaling system working across desktop, tablet, mobile breakpoints
- [ ] Animation framework implemented with configurable timing and easing
- [ ] Theme integration with light/dark mode support from existing Zustand store
- [ ] Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA) with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- [ ] Performance optimization for large datasets (10K+ data points per customer)
- [ ] Component library structure with Storybook documentation
- [ ] Unit tests achieving 90%+ coverage for all chart components
- [ ] Integration tests with existing dashboard framework components

## Implementation Notes
**Technical Architecture**:
- Use React useRef and useEffect hooks for D3.js integration
- Implement custom hooks for chart lifecycle management (useD3Chart)
- Create TypeScript interfaces for chart data structures and configuration
- Follow existing component library patterns from Phase 1 foundation
- Integrate with TailwindCSS utility classes for responsive design
- Use Zustand theme store for consistent color schemes

**Key Libraries and Dependencies**:
- D3.js v7+ (d3-selection, d3-scale, d3-axis, d3-shape, d3-transition)
- React 18+ with useId for unique chart identifiers
- TypeScript strict mode with proper type definitions
- Framer Motion for additional animation capabilities (optional)

**Performance Requirements**:
- Chart render time: <200ms for datasets up to 1000 points
- Memory usage: <50MB per chart instance
- Bundle size impact: <100KB additional to application bundle
- Responsive reflow: <100ms on window resize

## Dependencies
- Requires completion of Phase 1: Frontend Foundation (React app, dashboard framework, theme system)
- Integrates with existing Zustand stores (UI, Theme, Dashboard)
- Depends on TailwindCSS design system and component library structure
- Requires Storybook setup from Phase 1 development environment

## Related Tasks
- **Parent Phase**: Phase 2: Visualization Engine (Week 6-10)
- **Following Tasks**: Interactive Data Visualization (task-0020), Data Grid Components (task-0030), Manager Hierarchy Visualization (task-0040)
- **Integration Point**: Week 8 coordination with Developer B for data service APIs

## Child Tasks Breakdown
1. **task-0011**: Base Chart Architecture & React Integration
2. **task-0012**: Bar/Column Chart Components with Responsive Design
3. **task-0013**: Line/Area Chart Components with Animation Framework
4. **task-0014**: Pie/Donut Chart Components with Interactive Features
5. **task-0015**: Chart Library Testing, Documentation & Storybook Integration

## Success Metrics
- Component reusability: Used across 5+ dashboard types
- Performance target: <2s dashboard load times maintained
- Test coverage: 90%+ unit test coverage achieved
- Accessibility score: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance verified
- Developer experience: Complete TypeScript IntelliSense support
- Multi-tenant support: Customer-specific theming and data isolation working
