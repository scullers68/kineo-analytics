# Base Chart Architecture & React Integration

## Description
Establish the foundational architecture for D3.js chart components integrated with React, including custom hooks, TypeScript interfaces, and the base chart component structure. This forms the core foundation that all specific chart types will extend.

**Business Value**: Enables consistent, maintainable chart development across all visualization needs while ensuring optimal performance for multi-tenant SaaS platform.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] `useD3Chart` custom hook created with chart lifecycle management ✅ (completed in task-0010)
- [x] `BaseChart` component with common chart functionality (margins, axes, responsive container) ✅ (completed in task-0010)
- [x] TypeScript interfaces defined for `ChartData`, `ChartConfig`, `ChartDimensions` ✅ (completed in task-0010)
- [x] Chart container component with responsive sizing and theme integration ✅ (ResponsiveChart - completed in task-0010)
- [x] D3.js selection management with proper cleanup on unmount ✅ (completed in task-0010)
- [x] SVG setup with proper accessibility attributes (title, description, role) ✅ (AccessibleChart - completed in task-0010)
- [x] Chart utilities for common operations (scales, axes, formatting) ✅ (completed in task-0010)
- [x] Integration with existing Zustand theme store for color schemes ✅ (completed in task-0010)
- [x] Error boundary component for chart rendering failures ✅ (completed in task-0010)
- [x] Performance optimization with useMemo and useCallback for expensive operations ✅ (completed in task-0010)

## Implementation Notes
**Core Architecture**:
```typescript
// Custom hook for D3 chart management
const useD3Chart = (
  data: ChartData,
  config: ChartConfig,
  renderFn: (selection: Selection, data: ChartData, config: ChartConfig) => void
) => {
  const svgRef = useRef<SVGSVGElement>(null);
  const chartId = useId();
  
  // Chart lifecycle, resize handling, cleanup
}

// Base interfaces
interface ChartData {
  id: string | number;
  value: number;
  label: string;
  category?: string;
  metadata?: Record<string, any>;
}

interface ChartConfig {
  width?: number;
  height?: number;
  margin?: ChartMargin;
  theme?: 'light' | 'dark';
  responsive?: boolean;
  animate?: boolean;
}
```

**Integration Points**:
- Use existing `useBreakpoint` hook for responsive behavior
- Integrate with `useTheme` from Zustand store
- Follow component library patterns from Phase 1
- Implement proper TypeScript strict mode compliance

**Performance Considerations**:
- Implement chart data memoization to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Use ResizeObserver for efficient responsive updates
- Optimize D3 selections with proper enter/update/exit patterns
- Implement virtualization hooks for large datasets

## Dependencies
- Requires React 18+ with hooks and useId
- Needs existing Zustand theme store and useBreakpoint hook
- Depends on TailwindCSS design system
- Requires TypeScript configuration from Phase 1

## Related Tasks
- **Epic**: D3.js Chart Component Library Foundation (task-0010) - COMPLETED 2025-08-26
- **Implementation**: All work for this task was completed within the parent epic task-0010
- **Next Tasks**: Bar/Column Charts (task-0012) is the actual next implementation task
- **Integration**: Theme system, responsive utilities, error handling patterns - all established in task-0010

## Detailed Implementation Steps
1. **Create Chart Hook Structure**
   - Implement `useD3Chart` with proper TypeScript generics
   - Add chart lifecycle management (mount, update, unmount)
   - Integrate ResizeObserver for responsive behavior

2. **Define TypeScript Interfaces**
   - Create comprehensive `ChartData` interface supporting various data structures
   - Design `ChartConfig` for flexible chart configuration
   - Add utility types for margins, scales, and common chart properties

3. **Build Base Chart Component**
   - Create `BaseChart` with SVG container and responsive wrapper
   - Implement accessibility attributes and ARIA labels
   - Add error boundary for graceful chart failure handling

4. **Chart Utilities Library**
   - Common scale functions (linear, band, time scales)
   - Axis generators with consistent styling
   - Color palette integration with theme system
   - Data formatting utilities (numbers, dates, percentages)

5. **Integration Testing**
   - Test with existing dashboard grid system
   - Verify theme switching functionality
   - Validate responsive behavior across breakpoints
   - Ensure proper cleanup and memory management

### Key Project Learnings

**Epic Task Scope Management**: Successfully demonstrated that epic tasks (task-0010) can include child task scope when it creates more efficient development workflows. The foundation-first TDD approach accelerated development by establishing all architectural patterns simultaneously.

**TDD Methodology Success**: The RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle with comprehensive failing tests guided clean implementation and prevented over-engineering. Starting with 56 failing tests created clear success criteria.

**Parallel Development Enablement**: Foundation architecture established clear patterns for ongoing chart development, enabling task-0012 (Bar/Column Charts) to start immediately with proven React + D3.js integration patterns.

**Quality Assessment Process**: Six-step validation methodology (TDD Expert → Senior Engineer → Test Engineer → Quality Control → Task Phase Enforcer → Backlog Expert) provided accurate completion tracking and prevented scope creep.

### Dependencies and Next Steps
