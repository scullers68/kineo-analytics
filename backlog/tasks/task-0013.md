# Line/Area Chart Components with Animation Framework

## Description
Create sophisticated line and area chart components optimized for time-series learning analytics data. These components will visualize learning progress trends, completion rates over time, and engagement metrics across the Kineo Analytics platform's multi-tenant architecture.

**Business Value**: Enables trend analysis and progress tracking over time, critical for understanding learning effectiveness, identifying patterns in course completions, and supporting data-driven decisions for educational programs.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `LineChart` component with single and multi-series support
- [ ] `AreaChart` component with stacked and overlapping area variants
- [ ] Time-series axis handling with intelligent date formatting
- [ ] Smooth line/area drawing animations with path morphing
- [ ] Interactive data points with hover effects and tooltips
- [ ] Zoom and pan functionality for detailed time period analysis
- [ ] Responsive design with adaptive point density and label formatting
- [ ] Missing data handling with gaps or interpolation options
- [ ] Gradient fills for area charts with theme integration
- [ ] Grid lines and reference lines with customizable styling
- [ ] Legend component with series toggle functionality
- [ ] Crosshair cursor with synchronized multi-chart highlighting

## Implementation Notes
**Chart Variants**:
- **Simple Line**: Single data series over time
- **Multi-Line**: Multiple data series with legend and color differentiation
- **Area Chart**: Single series with filled area under curve
- **Stacked Area**: Multiple series stacked to show cumulative values
- **Stream Graph**: Symmetric stacked areas for aesthetic appeal

**Learning Analytics Use Cases**:
- Daily/weekly/monthly learning activity trends
- Course completion rates over fiscal years
- Certification renewal patterns and seasonal variations
- Learning engagement metrics across different time periods
- Comparative progress tracking between user groups or departments

**Animation System**:
```typescript
interface LineAnimationConfig {
  drawDuration: number;      // Line drawing animation: 1000ms
  pointDelay: number;        // Staggered point appearance: 100ms
  morphDuration: number;     // Data update morphing: 500ms
  easing: d3.EasingFunction; // Custom easing functions
  pathLength: boolean;       // Animate path drawing from start
}
```

**Time-Series Optimization**:
- Intelligent x-axis formatting (days, weeks, months, years)
- Adaptive point density based on data volume and screen size
- Efficient path generation using d3.line() with curve interpolation
- Performance optimization for datasets with 10K+ time points

## Dependencies
- **Requires**: Base Chart Architecture (task-0011) for foundation hooks and interfaces
- **Uses**: D3.js time scales, line generators, area generators, transitions
- **Integrates**: Existing responsive utilities and theme system

## Related Tasks
- **Epic**: D3.js Chart Component Library Foundation (task-0010)
- **Parallel**: Bar/Column Charts (task-0012), Pie/Donut Charts (task-0014)
- **Next**: Interactive Data Visualization features (task-0020)

## Detailed Implementation Steps

### 1. Line Chart Architecture
```typescript
interface LineChartProps {
  data: TimeSeriesData[];
  config: LineChartConfig;
  variant: 'simple' | 'multi-series';
  showPoints?: boolean;
  showArea?: boolean;
  onPointClick?: (point: TimeSeriesDataPoint) => void;
}

interface TimeSeriesData {
  id: string;
  label: string;
  color?: string;
  points: TimeSeriesDataPoint[];
}

interface TimeSeriesDataPoint {
  date: Date;
  value: number;
  metadata?: Record<string, any>;
}

interface LineChartConfig extends ChartConfig {
  interpolation: 'linear' | 'monotone' | 'cardinal' | 'step';
  showGrid: boolean;
  showLegend: boolean;
  zoomable: boolean;
  pannable: boolean;
  pointRadius: number;
  strokeWidth: number;
}
```

### 2. D3.js Path Generation
- Use `d3.scaleTime()` for x-axis temporal scaling
- Implement `d3.line()` with configurable curve interpolation
- Use `d3.area()` for filled area chart variants
- Optimize path generation for smooth curves and performance

### 3. Animation Framework
- Implement path length-based drawing animation using `stroke-dasharray`
- Create smooth morphing transitions between data updates
- Add staggered point appearance with configurable delays
- Respect user motion preferences and provide animation toggles

### 4. Interactivity Features
- **Hover Effects**: Highlight nearest data point with smooth transitions
- **Tooltips**: Rich contextual information with formatted dates and values
- **Zoom/Pan**: D3.js brush or zoom behavior for time period selection
- **Crosshair**: Vertical line following mouse with value indicators
- **Legend Interaction**: Click to toggle series visibility

### 5. Responsive Time-Series Handling
```typescript
// Adaptive formatting based on time range and screen size
const formatTimeAxis = (domain: [Date, Date], width: number) => {
  const timeSpan = domain[1].getTime() - domain[0].getTime();
  const pixelsPerTick = width / 8; // Target 8 ticks max
  
  if (timeSpan < DAY) return d3.timeFormat('%H:%M');
  if (timeSpan < MONTH) return d3.timeFormat('%m/%d');
  if (timeSpan < YEAR) return d3.timeFormat('%b %Y');
  return d3.timeFormat('%Y');
};
```

### 6. Area Chart Enhancements
- Gradient fills using SVG `<linearGradient>` with theme colors
- Stacked area calculations with proper baseline management
- Stream graph layout for symmetric, flowing visualizations
- Alpha transparency handling for overlapping areas

### 7. Performance Optimizations
- Canvas fallback for datasets exceeding 5000 points
- Point culling for zoom levels that don't show individual points
- Efficient data binding with proper enter/update/exit patterns
- Memoization of expensive calculations (scales, paths, areas)

### 8. Missing Data Handling
- Gap detection in time series data
- Configurable interpolation vs. broken line rendering
- Visual indicators for data quality and completeness
- Proper handling of sparse datasets

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Path generation, animations, data transformations
- **Integration Tests**: Theme switching, responsive behavior, user interactions
- **Performance Tests**: Large dataset rendering, smooth animations, memory usage
- **Accessibility Tests**: Keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility
- **Visual Tests**: Cross-browser rendering, animation smoothness

## Storybook Documentation
- Interactive stories for all chart variants and configurations
- Time-series data generators for consistent testing
- Animation playground with timing and easing controls
- Responsive behavior demonstrations
- Accessibility feature walkthroughs

## Success Metrics
- Smooth 60fps animations for line drawing and interactions
- <200ms render time for datasets up to 1000 points
- Responsive behavior verified across all breakpoints
- 100% accessibility compliance for keyboard and screen reader users
- Zero memory leaks during data updates and animations
