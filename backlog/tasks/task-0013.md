# Line/Area Chart Components with Animation Framework

## Description
Create sophisticated line and area chart components optimized for time-series learning analytics data. These components will visualize learning progress trends, completion rates over time, and engagement metrics across the Kineo Analytics platform's multi-tenant architecture.

**Business Value**: Enables trend analysis and progress tracking over time, critical for understanding learning effectiveness, identifying patterns in course completions, and supporting data-driven decisions for educational programs.

## Implementation Plan

### TDD Approach for Line/Area Charts
Following the successful TDD methodology from task-0010 and task-0012, implementing comprehensive failing tests first to guide the development of sophisticated time-series visualization components:

**Testing Strategy**:
1. **RED Phase**: Create 80-100 failing tests covering all acceptance criteria
2. **GREEN Phase**: Implement minimal components to make tests pass
3. **REFACTOR Phase**: Optimize performance and code quality while maintaining test coverage

**Test Categories** (All should fail initially):
- Core Components: LineChart, AreaChart, StreamGraphChart components
- Chart Variants: 5 variants (Simple Line, Multi-Line, Area, Stacked Area, Stream Graph)
- Time-Series Specialization: d3.scaleTime integration and intelligent formatting
- Animation Framework: Path drawing, morphing, staggered animations
- Interactive Features: Hover effects, tooltips, zoom/pan, crosshair cursor
- Responsive Design: Mobile/tablet/desktop breakpoint handling
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with keyboard navigation
- Performance: <200ms render time, 60fps animations, memory efficiency
- Missing Data Handling: Gap detection and interpolation options

**Foundation Integration**:
- Build on proven architecture from task-0011 (base chart interfaces and hooks)
- Leverage successful patterns from task-0012 (chart variants and responsive design)
- Maintain compatibility with existing test infrastructure

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] `LineChart` component with single and multi-series support
- [x] `AreaChart` component with stacked and overlapping area variants
- [x] Time-series axis handling with intelligent date formatting
- [x] Smooth line/area drawing animations with path morphing
- [x] Interactive data points with hover effects and tooltips
- [x] Zoom and pan functionality for detailed time period analysis
- [x] Responsive design with adaptive point density and label formatting
- [x] Missing data handling with gaps or interpolation options
- [x] Gradient fills for area charts with theme integration
- [x] Grid lines and reference lines with customizable styling
- [x] Legend component with series toggle functionality
- [x] Crosshair cursor with synchronized multi-chart highlighting

## Implementation Notes
**Chart Variants**:
- **Simple Line**: Single data series over time
- **Multi-Line**: Multiple data series with legend and color differentiation
- **Area Chart**: Single series with filled area under curve
- **Stacked Area**: Multiple series stacked to show cumulative values
- **Stream Graph**: Symmetric stacked areas for aesthetic appeal

**Learning Analytics Use Cases**:
- Daily/weekly/monthly learning activity trends
- Course completion rates over fiscal years
- Certification renewal patterns and seasonal variations
- Learning engagement metrics across different time periods
- Comparative progress tracking between user groups or departments

**Animation System**:
```typescript
interface LineAnimationConfig {
  drawDuration: number;      // Line drawing animation: 1000ms
  pointDelay: number;        // Staggered point appearance: 100ms
  morphDuration: number;     // Data update morphing: 500ms
  easing: d3.EasingFunction; // Custom easing functions
  pathLength: boolean;       // Animate path drawing from start
}
```

**Time-Series Optimization**:
- Intelligent x-axis formatting (days, weeks, months, years)
- Adaptive point density based on data volume and screen size
- Efficient path generation using d3.line() with curve interpolation
- Performance optimization for datasets with 10K+ time points

## Dependencies
- **Requires**: Base Chart Architecture (task-0011) for foundation hooks and interfaces
- **Uses**: D3.js time scales, line generators, area generators, transitions
- **Integrates**: Existing responsive utilities and theme system

## Related Tasks
- **Epic**: D3.js Chart Component Library Foundation (task-0010)
- **Parallel**: Bar/Column Charts (task-0012), Pie/Donut Charts (task-0014)
- **Next**: Interactive Data Visualization features (task-0020)

## Detailed Implementation Steps

### 1. Line Chart Architecture
```typescript
interface LineChartProps {
  data: TimeSeriesData[];
  config: LineChartConfig;
  variant: 'simple' | 'multi-series';
  showPoints?: boolean;
  showArea?: boolean;
  onPointClick?: (point: TimeSeriesDataPoint) => void;
}

interface TimeSeriesData {
  id: string;
  label: string;
  color?: string;
  points: TimeSeriesDataPoint[];
}

interface TimeSeriesDataPoint {
  date: Date;
  value: number;
  metadata?: Record<string, any>;
}

interface LineChartConfig extends ChartConfig {
  interpolation: 'linear' | 'monotone' | 'cardinal' | 'step';
  showGrid: boolean;
  showLegend: boolean;
  zoomable: boolean;
  pannable: boolean;
  pointRadius: number;
  strokeWidth: number;
}
```

### 2. D3.js Path Generation
- Use `d3.scaleTime()` for x-axis temporal scaling
- Implement `d3.line()` with configurable curve interpolation
- Use `d3.area()` for filled area chart variants
- Optimize path generation for smooth curves and performance

### 3. Animation Framework
- Implement path length-based drawing animation using `stroke-dasharray`
- Create smooth morphing transitions between data updates
- Add staggered point appearance with configurable delays
- Respect user motion preferences and provide animation toggles

### 4. Interactivity Features
- **Hover Effects**: Highlight nearest data point with smooth transitions
- **Tooltips**: Rich contextual information with formatted dates and values
- **Zoom/Pan**: D3.js brush or zoom behavior for time period selection
- **Crosshair**: Vertical line following mouse with value indicators
- **Legend Interaction**: Click to toggle series visibility

### 5. Responsive Time-Series Handling
```typescript
// Adaptive formatting based on time range and screen size
const formatTimeAxis = (domain: [Date, Date], width: number) => {
  const timeSpan = domain[1].getTime() - domain[0].getTime();
  const pixelsPerTick = width / 8; // Target 8 ticks max
  
  if (timeSpan < DAY) return d3.timeFormat('%H:%M');
  if (timeSpan < MONTH) return d3.timeFormat('%m/%d');
  if (timeSpan < YEAR) return d3.timeFormat('%b %Y');
  return d3.timeFormat('%Y');
};
```

### 6. Area Chart Enhancements
- Gradient fills using SVG `<linearGradient>` with theme colors
- Stacked area calculations with proper baseline management
- Stream graph layout for symmetric, flowing visualizations
- Alpha transparency handling for overlapping areas

### 7. Performance Optimizations
- Canvas fallback for datasets exceeding 5000 points
- Point culling for zoom levels that don't show individual points
- Efficient data binding with proper enter/update/exit patterns
- Memoization of expensive calculations (scales, paths, areas)

### 8. Missing Data Handling
- Gap detection in time series data
- Configurable interpolation vs. broken line rendering
- Visual indicators for data quality and completeness
- Proper handling of sparse datasets

## Testing Strategy
