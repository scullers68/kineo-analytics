# EPIC - Interactive Data Visualization Features

## Description
Develop comprehensive interactive features that transform static charts into dynamic, explorable visualizations. This includes drill-down navigation systems, advanced filtering and brushing capabilities, rich hover effects and tooltips, zoom and pan functionality, and chart export capabilities. These features are essential for providing deep learning analytics insights across Kineo's multi-tenant SaaS platform.

**Business Value**: Enables users to explore learning data interactively, drill down from high-level metrics to individual learner details, filter data dynamically for focused analysis, and export insights for reporting and sharing. Critical for providing actionable learning analytics that drive educational program improvements.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Drill-down navigation system supporting hierarchical data exploration
- [ ] Advanced filtering interface with real-time chart updates
- [ ] Rich hover effects and contextual tooltips with formatted data
- [ ] Zoom and pan functionality for detailed time-series analysis
- [ ] Chart export capabilities (PNG, SVG, PDF) with proper branding
- [ ] Brushing and linking across multiple related charts
- [ ] Interactive legend with series toggle and highlighting
- [ ] Keyboard navigation support for accessibility compliance
- [ ] Touch-optimized interactions for mobile and tablet devices
- [ ] Performance optimization for real-time interactions with large datasets
- [ ] Integration with customer context for multi-tenant data isolation
- [ ] Undo/redo functionality for complex filtering operations

## Implementation Notes
**Core Interactive Features**:
- **Drill-Down System**: Navigate from department → team → individual learner
- **Cross-Filtering**: Filter one chart affects related visualizations
- **Brushing**: Select time periods or data ranges with visual feedback
- **Tooltip System**: Rich, context-aware information panels
- **Export Engine**: High-quality output with customer branding

**Learning Analytics Use Cases**:
- Course completion trends → drill to specific courses → individual learners
- Certification overview → filter by expiration dates → renewal actions needed
- Manager hierarchy → team performance → individual progress tracking
- Program effectiveness → filter by completion status → detailed learning paths

**Performance Requirements**:
- Interactive response time: <100ms for hover effects and tooltips
- Filter operations: <300ms for datasets up to 10,000 records
- Export generation: <2 seconds for high-resolution chart images
- Cross-chart updates: <500ms for linked visualization updates

## Dependencies
- **Requires**: D3.js Chart Component Library Foundation (task-0010)
- **Integrates**: Dashboard framework, customer context, theme system
- **Uses**: React state management, D3.js interaction handlers, canvas/SVG rendering

## Related Tasks
