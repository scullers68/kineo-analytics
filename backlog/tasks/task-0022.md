# Chart Filtering and Real-Time Updates

## Description
Build an interactive filtering system that enables users to dynamically explore learning analytics data with immediate chart updates. Users can apply multiple filters simultaneously and see results reflected across all visualization components without page reloads.

**Foundation Ready**: Complete D3.js chart library with proven rendering capabilities provides the base for interactive filtering integration.

**Business Value**: Enables users to focus on specific data segments (date ranges, departments, course types) and explore patterns through dynamic filtering without losing context or waiting for page refreshes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Multi-criteria filter controls (date range, categories, value ranges)
- [ ] Real-time chart updates reflecting filter changes immediately
- [ ] Filter state synchronization across multiple charts
- [ ] Clear/reset filters functionality with smooth transitions
- [ ] Visual indicators showing active filters and applied criteria

## Lean TDD Implementation Strategy

**Testing Philosophy**: Focus on filter interactions and data flow with 7 targeted tests covering core functionality.

### TDD Test Plan (7 Tests Total)
Following the six-step methodology from CLAUDE.md:

#### Filter Control Tests (3 tests)
1. **Filter UI Rendering**: Test filter components render with correct options and default states
2. **Multi-Filter Application**: Test applying multiple filters simultaneously updates chart data correctly
3. **Filter State Management**: Test filter state persists and updates properly across user interactions

#### Real-Time Update Tests (2 tests) 
4. **Immediate Chart Updates**: Test chart components re-render within <300ms of filter changes
5. **Data Synchronization**: Test filtered data propagates correctly to all connected chart components

#### Filter System Integration Tests (2 tests)
6. **Clear/Reset Functionality**: Test clearing filters returns charts to original data state
7. **Filter Persistence**: Test filter state maintains consistency during chart interactions

### Implementation Scope
- **FilterProvider**: React context for centralized filter state management
- **FilterControls**: Reusable filter component library (date, category, range filters)
- **useChartFilter**: Custom hook for connecting charts to filter system
- **FilterBar**: Visual filter display with active filter indicators

### Learning Analytics Filter Types
- **Date Range Filters**: Select specific time periods for trend analysis
- **Category Filters**: Filter by department, course type, certification status
- **Value Range Filters**: Filter by completion percentages, learning hours
- **Multi-Select Filters**: Combine multiple criteria for complex filtering

## Technical Implementation

### Component Architecture
```typescript
interface FilterState {
  dateRange?: { start: Date; end: Date }
  categories?: string[]
  valueRange?: { min: number; max: number }
  activeFilters: FilterCriteria[]
}

interface FilterCriteria {
  type: 'date' | 'category' | 'value'
  label: string
  value: any
  onRemove: () => void
}
```

### Integration Points
- **Chart Components**: All existing charts (BarChart, LineChart, PieChart) enhanced with filter support
- **Data Processing**: Efficient filtering algorithms for large datasets
- **State Management**: Centralized filter state with React Context
- **Visual Feedback**: Loading states and transition animations

## Performance Requirements
- Filter application: <200ms response time for datasets up to 10K records
- Chart updates: <300ms re-render time after filter changes
- Memory efficiency: Optimized filtering algorithms to prevent memory leaks
- Smooth animations: D3.js transitions maintain 60fps during updates

## Dependencies
- **Foundation**: D3.js Chart Component Library (task-0010) âœ… COMPLETED
- **Integration**: All existing chart components for filter connectivity
- **Data Utils**: Efficient filtering and data processing utilities

## Success Metrics
- User engagement: Filtering used in 40%+ of chart interactions
- Performance: All filter operations maintain <200ms response time
- Usability: Intuitive filter interface verified through user testing
- Data accuracy: Filtered results match expected criteria 100% of time
