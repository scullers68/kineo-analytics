# Zoom and Pan for Time-Series Exploration

## Description
Build comprehensive zoom and pan functionality specifically optimized for time-series charts, enabling users to explore detailed patterns in learning analytics data across different time scales. Users can zoom into specific time periods and pan across extended timelines while maintaining smooth performance.

**Foundation Ready**: Complete D3.js chart library with proven time-series rendering and existing brush selection capabilities provides the base for advanced zoom/pan interactions.

**Business Value**: Enables detailed analysis of learning trends over time, allowing users to identify patterns in course completions, seasonal variations, and long-term progress trends that are not visible in overview charts.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Mouse wheel and touch zoom functionality with configurable zoom limits
- [x] Click-and-drag pan across extended time periods
- [x] Zoom controls with preset time ranges (1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 1 year)
- [x] Mini-map overview showing current zoom window in context
- [x] Reset zoom functionality returning to original time range

## Lean TDD Implementation Strategy

**Testing Philosophy**: Focus on zoom/pan mechanics, performance, and user interaction patterns with 9 targeted tests covering core functionality.

### TDD Test Plan (9 Tests Total)
Following the six-step methodology from CLAUDE.md:

#### Zoom Functionality Tests (4 tests)
1. **Mouse Wheel Zoom**: Test zoom in/out responds correctly to mouse wheel events
2. **Zoom Limits**: Test zoom respects minimum and maximum scale constraints
3. **Zoom Controls**: Test preset zoom buttons (1W, 1M, 3M, 1Y) set correct time ranges
4. **Zoom State Management**: Test zoom level persists during chart updates

#### Pan Functionality Tests (3 tests)
5. **Click-Drag Pan**: Test smooth panning responds to mouse drag gestures
6. **Pan Boundaries**: Test panning stops at data boundaries and doesn't show empty areas
7. **Touch Pan Support**: Test pan functionality works on mobile/tablet devices

#### Integration & Performance Tests (2 tests)
8. **Mini-Map Sync**: Test mini-map indicator reflects current zoom/pan position accurately
9. **Zoom Performance**: Test zoom/pan operations maintain <100ms response time

### Implementation Scope
- **ZoomPanProvider**: React context for zoom/pan state management
- **ZoomControls**: UI controls for preset zoom levels and reset functionality
- **PanHandler**: Touch and mouse gesture handling for smooth panning
- **MiniMapOverview**: Small overview chart showing current zoom window
- **useZoomPan**: Custom hook integrating D3.js zoom behavior with React

### Learning Analytics Time-Series Use Cases
- **Daily Activity Patterns**: Zoom into specific days to analyze hourly learning activity
- **Seasonal Trends**: Pan across years to identify seasonal completion patterns
- **Course Launch Impact**: Zoom into course release periods to measure adoption
- **Progress Tracking**: Detailed examination of individual learner progress over time

## Technical Implementation

### Component Architecture
```typescript
interface ZoomPanState {
  scale: number
  translateX: number
  translateY: number
  timeExtent: [Date, Date]
  zoomLevel: 'day' | 'week' | 'month' | 'quarter' | 'year' | 'custom'
}

interface ZoomControls {
  zoomIn: () => void
  zoomOut: () => void
  resetZoom: () => void
  setPresetZoom: (period: string) => void
  panTo: (date: Date) => void
}
```

### D3.js Integration Points
- **d3.zoom()**: Core zoom behavior with scale extent and smooth transitions
- **d3.scaleTime()**: Dynamic time scale updates during zoom/pan operations
- **d3.brush()**: Mini-map selection for jump-to-time functionality
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient rendering during continuous zoom/pan

## Performance Requirements
- Zoom operations: <100ms response time for smooth user interaction
- Pan gestures: 60fps during drag operations for fluid movement
- Data updates: <200ms to re-render chart elements after zoom changes
- Memory efficiency: Optimized data loading for different zoom levels

## Mobile & Touch Optimization
- **Pinch-to-Zoom**: Two-finger pinch gestures for mobile zoom
- **Touch Pan**: Single-finger drag for panning across time periods
- **Touch Feedback**: Visual feedback during touch interactions
- **Gesture Conflicts**: Prevent conflicts with browser zoom and scroll

## Integration Points
- **Line Charts**: Primary focus for time-series zoom/pan functionality
- **Area Charts**: Full zoom/pan support for stacked time-series data
- **Multi-Chart Sync**: Option to synchronize zoom/pan across related charts
- **Filter Integration**: Zoom/pan state considered in filtering operations

## Dependencies
- **Foundation**: D3.js Chart Component Library (task-0010) ✅ COMPLETED
- **Brush Selection**: Existing brush functionality for mini-map integration
- **Time-Series Charts**: LineChart and AreaChart components for integration

## Success Metrics
- User engagement: Zoom/pan used in 25%+ of time-series chart interactions
- Performance: All zoom/pan operations maintain <100ms response time
- Mobile usability: Touch interactions work seamlessly on all devices
- Data exploration: Users discover 40% more insights through detailed time examination

## Implementation Plan
**Step 1 (TDD Expert)**: Create 9 comprehensive failing tests following the lean TDD strategy outlined above. Tests will define zoom/pan behavior, performance requirements, and integration patterns.

**TDD Strategy**: Focus on user interactions and zoom/pan mechanics with clear test boundaries. All tests will initially fail to establish RED phase before any implementation begins.

**Test File**: `/frontend/tests/zoom-pan/time-series-zoom.test.tsx`
