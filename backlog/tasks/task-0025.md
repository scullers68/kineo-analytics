# Chart Export with Multiple Formats

## Description
Build a comprehensive export system enabling users to save charts in multiple formats (PNG, SVG, PDF) with professional quality and customer-specific branding. The system will support high-resolution output suitable for presentations, reports, and external sharing.

**Foundation Ready**: Complete D3.js chart library with SVG rendering provides the base for high-quality export functionality across multiple formats.

**Business Value**: Enables users to include learning analytics insights in presentations, reports, and external communications with professional formatting and customer branding, increasing the value and reach of analytics insights.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] PNG export with configurable resolution and quality settings
- [x] SVG export maintaining vector graphics and interactive elements
- [x] PDF export with multi-chart layouts and professional formatting
- [x] Customer branding integration (logos, colors, typography)
- [x] Batch export functionality for multiple charts simultaneously

## Lean TDD Implementation Strategy

**Testing Philosophy**: Focus on export format generation, quality verification, and branding application with 8 targeted tests covering essential functionality.

### TDD Test Plan (8 Tests Total)
Following the six-step methodology from CLAUDE.md:

#### Format Generation Tests (3 tests)
1. **PNG Export**: Test high-resolution PNG generation with correct dimensions and quality
2. **SVG Export**: Test vector SVG output maintains chart fidelity and scalability
3. **PDF Export**: Test PDF generation with proper layout and embedded graphics

#### Branding Integration Tests (2 tests)
4. **Customer Logo**: Test customer logos are correctly positioned and sized in exports
5. **Brand Colors**: Test customer color schemes are applied consistently across export formats

#### Export System Tests (3 tests)
6. **Export Quality**: Test exported files maintain visual fidelity compared to screen rendering
7. **Batch Export**: Test multiple charts can be exported together in single operation
8. **Export Performance**: Test export generation completes within <2 seconds per chart

### Implementation Scope
- **ExportProvider**: React context for export configuration and customer branding
- **ExportDialog**: Modal interface for export options and format selection
- **FormatHandlers**: Specialized handlers for PNG, SVG, and PDF generation
- **BrandingEngine**: System for applying customer-specific branding elements
- **BatchExporter**: Utility for exporting multiple charts with consistent formatting

### Export Format Features

- Code organization and reusability improvements
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback systems

### Test Architecture
Tests will be organized in `/frontend/tests/export/chart-export.test.tsx` covering:
- **Unit Tests**: Individual format handlers and branding engine components
- **Integration Tests**: Export dialog interaction with chart components from Task-0010
- **Performance Tests**: Timing validation for export operations
- **Quality Tests**: Visual output verification and branding consistency

### Implementation Dependencies
