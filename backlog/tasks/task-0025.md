# Chart Export with Multiple Formats

## Description
Build a comprehensive export system enabling users to save charts in multiple formats (PNG, SVG, PDF) with professional quality and customer-specific branding. The system will support high-resolution output suitable for presentations, reports, and external sharing.

**Foundation Ready**: Complete D3.js chart library with SVG rendering provides the base for high-quality export functionality across multiple formats.

**Business Value**: Enables users to include learning analytics insights in presentations, reports, and external communications with professional formatting and customer branding, increasing the value and reach of analytics insights.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] PNG export with configurable resolution and quality settings
- [ ] SVG export maintaining vector graphics and interactive elements
- [ ] PDF export with multi-chart layouts and professional formatting
- [ ] Customer branding integration (logos, colors, typography)
- [ ] Batch export functionality for multiple charts simultaneously

## Lean TDD Implementation Strategy

**Testing Philosophy**: Focus on export format generation, quality verification, and branding application with 8 targeted tests covering essential functionality.

### TDD Test Plan (8 Tests Total)
Following the six-step methodology from CLAUDE.md:

#### Format Generation Tests (3 tests)
1. **PNG Export**: Test high-resolution PNG generation with correct dimensions and quality
2. **SVG Export**: Test vector SVG output maintains chart fidelity and scalability
3. **PDF Export**: Test PDF generation with proper layout and embedded graphics

#### Branding Integration Tests (2 tests)
4. **Customer Logo**: Test customer logos are correctly positioned and sized in exports
5. **Brand Colors**: Test customer color schemes are applied consistently across export formats

#### Export System Tests (3 tests)
6. **Export Quality**: Test exported files maintain visual fidelity compared to screen rendering
7. **Batch Export**: Test multiple charts can be exported together in single operation
8. **Export Performance**: Test export generation completes within <2 seconds per chart

### Implementation Scope
- **ExportProvider**: React context for export configuration and customer branding
- **ExportDialog**: Modal interface for export options and format selection
- **FormatHandlers**: Specialized handlers for PNG, SVG, and PDF generation
- **BrandingEngine**: System for applying customer-specific branding elements
- **BatchExporter**: Utility for exporting multiple charts with consistent formatting

### Export Format Features
- **PNG Export**: High-resolution raster graphics for web and print use
- **SVG Export**: Scalable vector graphics preserving interactivity and quality
- **PDF Export**: Professional document format with multi-chart layouts
- **Custom Sizing**: Configurable dimensions for different use cases
- **Quality Settings**: Balance between file size and visual quality

## Technical Implementation

### Component Architecture
```typescript
interface ExportConfig {
  format: 'png' | 'svg' | 'pdf'
  dimensions: { width: number; height: number }
  quality: 'standard' | 'high' | 'print'
  branding: CustomerBranding
  filename?: string
}

interface CustomerBranding {
  logo?: string
  colors: { primary: string; secondary: string; background: string }
  typography: { fontFamily: string; fontSize: number }
  watermark?: boolean
}
```

### Export Quality Standards
- **PNG**: 300 DPI resolution for print quality, 72 DPI for web use
- **SVG**: Preserved vector paths with embedded fonts and styles
- **PDF**: Professional layout with proper margins and typography
- **File Size**: Optimized compression while maintaining visual quality

## Customer Branding Features
- **Logo Placement**: Configurable logo positioning (header, footer, watermark)
- **Color Schemes**: Customer-specific color palettes applied to all chart elements
- **Typography**: Brand-consistent fonts and text formatting
- **Layout Templates**: Professional templates for different export contexts

## Performance Requirements
- Export generation: <2 seconds per chart for standard quality
- High-resolution exports: <5 seconds for print-quality PNG
- PDF compilation: <3 seconds for multi-chart documents
- Memory efficiency: Large exports don't cause browser memory issues

## Integration Points
- **All Chart Types**: Export support for BarChart, LineChart, PieChart, and variants
- **Customer Context**: Integration with multi-tenant customer branding system
- **File Management**: Browser download handling and file naming conventions
- **Quality Settings**: User-configurable quality vs. file size trade-offs

## Use Cases
- **Executive Presentations**: High-quality charts for board meetings and presentations
- **Client Reports**: Branded charts for external customer reporting
- **Documentation**: SVG exports for technical documentation and web use
- **Print Materials**: High-resolution PNG for brochures and printed materials

## Dependencies
- **Foundation**: D3.js Chart Component Library (task-0010) âœ… COMPLETED
- **Customer Context**: Multi-tenant customer branding and theming system
- **File Handling**: Browser APIs for download and file management

## Success Metrics
- User adoption: Export functionality used by 20%+ of active users
- Quality satisfaction: Exported charts meet professional presentation standards
- Performance: All export operations complete within performance targets
- Branding consistency: Customer branding applied correctly in 100% of exports
