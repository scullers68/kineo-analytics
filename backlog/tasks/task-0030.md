# EPIC - Data Grid and Table Components

## Description
Create high-performance data grid and table components optimized for displaying large learning analytics datasets with advanced features like sorting, filtering, virtual scrolling, column management, and data export. These components will handle learner records, course completions, certification tracking, and detailed reporting across Kineo's multi-tenant platform.

**Business Value**: Provides detailed tabular data views that complement chart visualizations, enabling users to examine individual records, perform detailed analysis, and export data for further processing. Essential for administrative users, managers, and compliance reporting requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] High-performance data grid with virtual scrolling for 10K+ records
- [ ] Advanced sorting capabilities (multi-column, custom sort functions)
- [ ] Real-time filtering with search, date ranges, and categorical filters
- [ ] Configurable column management (resize, reorder, hide/show)
- [ ] Row selection with bulk operations and keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Pagination with configurable page sizes and navigation
- [ ] Data export functionality (CSV, Excel, PDF) with formatting options
- [ ] Responsive design adapting to mobile and tablet screen sizes
- [ ] Integration with chart components for coordinated data exploration
- [ ] Accessibility compliance with screen reader and keyboard support
- [ ] Customer context awareness for multi-tenant data isolation
- [ ] Loading states and error handling for async data operations

## Implementation Notes
**Grid Features**:
- **Virtual Scrolling**: Render only visible rows for performance
- **Column Types**: Text, numeric, date, boolean, custom components
- **Filter Types**: Text search, date ranges, multi-select dropdowns, numeric ranges
- **Sort Types**: Alphabetic, numeric, date, custom comparators
- **Selection**: Single, multiple, range selection with checkboxes

**Learning Analytics Data Types**:
- Learner records (name, department, manager, enrollment status)
- Course completion data (dates, scores, time spent, status)
- Certification tracking (issue dates, expiration, renewal status)
- Learning activity logs (SCORM interactions, seminar attendance)
- Manager hierarchy data (reporting relationships, team performance)

**Performance Optimizations**:
```typescript
interface VirtualScrollConfig {
  itemHeight: number;        // Fixed or dynamic row heights
  bufferSize: number;        // Rows to render outside viewport
  threshold: number;         // Records count to enable virtualization
  estimatedItemSize: number; // For dynamic height estimation
}
```

**Responsive Behavior**:
- Desktop: Full column set, advanced filtering, multi-select operations
- Tablet: Priority columns, simplified filtering, swipe actions
- Mobile: Card-based layout, essential columns only, touch-optimized controls

## Dependencies
- **Foundation**: Base chart architecture and component patterns
- **Integration**: Dashboard framework, customer context, theme system
- **Libraries**: React Virtual (or similar), date-fns for date handling

## Related Tasks
- **Foundation**: Chart Component Library (task-0010)
- **Parallel**: Interactive Data Visualization (task-0020), Manager Hierarchy (task-0040)
- **Integration**: Dashboard Implementation (Phase 3)

## Child Tasks Breakdown
1. **task-0031**: Sortable/Filterable Data Tables with Advanced Search
2. **task-0032**: Virtual Scrolling Implementation for Large Datasets
3. **task-0033**: Column Management (Resize, Reorder, Hide/Show)
4. **task-0034**: Data Export Functionality (CSV, Excel, PDF)
5. **task-0035**: Pagination and Search Components with Performance Optimization

## Success Metrics
- Performance: <500ms load time for 10,000 record datasets
- Smooth scrolling: 60fps during virtual scroll operations
- Filter responsiveness: <200ms for search and filter operations
- Export speed: <3 seconds for datasets up to 5,000 records
- Mobile experience: Full functionality on touch devices
- Accessibility: 100% keyboard navigation and screen reader support
