# EPIC - Manager Hierarchy Visualization

## Description
Build interactive organizational hierarchy visualization components that display complex manager-employee relationships across 7,794 relationships (self, direct, and indirect). These components will support learning analytics by enabling navigation through organizational structures, team performance visualization, and reporting hierarchy exploration for Kineo's multi-tenant platform.

**Business Value**: Enables managers to understand team structures, track learning progress across reporting hierarchies, identify training gaps at organizational levels, and support cascade reporting for compliance and performance management.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Interactive organizational chart component with expandable/collapsible nodes
- [ ] Tree and network graph visualizations for different hierarchy views
- [ ] Node-based data visualization (completion rates, certification status per person/team)
- [ ] Search and navigation functionality to locate specific employees
- [ ] Drill-down capabilities from department level to individual contributors
- [ ] Manager reporting views with team performance aggregations
- [ ] Responsive design adapting from full org chart to mobile-friendly tree views
- [ ] Integration with learning analytics data (progress, completions, certifications)
- [ ] Performance optimization for large organizational structures (1000+ employees)
- [ ] Accessibility support for keyboard navigation and screen readers
- [ ] Multi-tenant support with customer-specific organizational data
- [ ] Export capabilities for org charts and reporting hierarchies

## Implementation Notes
**Hierarchy Data Structure**:
```typescript
interface HierarchyNode {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  title: string;
  department: string;
  managerId?: string;
  directReports: string[];
  learningMetrics: {
    completionRate: number;
    certificationsActive: number;
    overdueCourses: number;
    learningHours: number;
  };
  metadata: Record<string, any>;
}
```

**Visualization Types**:
- **Org Chart**: Traditional hierarchical tree layout
- **Network Graph**: Force-directed layout showing relationships
- **Compact Tree**: Space-efficient vertical or horizontal tree
- **Sunburst**: Radial hierarchy for large organizations
- **Matrix View**: Table-based hierarchy with learning metrics

**Learning Analytics Integration**:
- Color-code nodes by completion rates or certification status
- Size nodes by team size or learning activity volume
- Show progress indicators and alerts for overdue training
- Aggregate team metrics at each management level
- Highlight high-performers and at-risk employees

**Performance Considerations**:
- Lazy loading for large organizational structures
- Virtual rendering for organizations with 500+ employees
- Efficient data structures for hierarchy calculations
- Optimized re-rendering when expanding/collapsing nodes

## Dependencies
- **Foundation**: D3.js Chart Component Library (task-0010) for graph layouts
- **Data**: Manager hierarchy algorithm results from backend (7,794 relationships)
- **Integration**: Dashboard framework, search components, data grid components

## Related Tasks
- **Foundation**: Chart Component Library (task-0010)
- **Data Source**: Backend manager hierarchy algorithm implementation
- **Integration**: Interactive Data Visualization (task-0020), Data Grid (task-0030)

## Child Tasks Breakdown
1. **task-0041**: Interactive Org Chart Component with D3.js Tree Layout
2. **task-0042**: Tree/Network Graph Visualization with Force-Directed Layout  
3. **task-0043**: Expandable/Collapsible Hierarchy Nodes with Animation
4. **task-0044**: Hierarchy Search and Navigation with Employee Lookup
5. **task-0045**: Manager Reporting Drill-Down Views with Team Analytics

## Success Metrics
- Performance: <1 second load time for hierarchies up to 1,000 employees
- Interactivity: Smooth expand/collapse animations at 60fps
- Search speed: <300ms to locate any employee in the organization
- Mobile usability: Full navigation functionality on touch devices
- Data accuracy: 100% alignment with backend hierarchy calculations
- Manager adoption: 80%+ of managers use hierarchy views for team analysis
