# Authentication UI Components (1.2) - JWT & Multi-Customer

## Description

Build the authentication layer for the Kineo Analytics multi-customer SaaS platform. This task implements JWT-based authentication with customer context switching, building on the foundation architecture from Task 1.1.

**DEPENDENCY ON TASK 1.1**: Requires the React application architecture, Zustand stores, and responsive layout components from Task 1.1 (currently at 62.5% completion).

## Business Context

This authentication system supports the strategic transformation from single-customer to multi-customer SaaS platform:
- **Customer Isolation**: Each customer gets secure, isolated access to their data
- **Context Switching**: Support for customer administrators managing multiple accounts  
- **JWT Security**: Token-based authentication with refresh capabilities
- **Responsive Design**: Works across mobile, tablet, and desktop interfaces

## Acceptance Criteria

### Phase 1: Login/Logout Components (Day 1)
- [ ] **Login Form Component**
  - [ ] Email/password form with validation
  - [ ] Customer selection dropdown (for multi-customer users)
  - [ ] Loading states and error handling
  - [ ] Responsive design with mobile-first approach
  - [ ] Integration with auth Zustand store

### Phase 2: JWT Token Management (Day 1-2)
- [ ] **Authentication Store Enhancement**  
  - [ ] JWT token storage and refresh logic
  - [ ] Customer context management
  - [ ] Automatic token refresh before expiration
  - [ ] Logout and session cleanup
  - [ ] SSR-safe hydration

### Phase 3: Protected Route System (Day 2)
- [ ] **Route Protection Components**
  - [ ] ProtectedRoute wrapper component
  - [ ] Authentication guards for dashboard routes
  - [ ] Customer context validation
  - [ ] Redirect logic for unauthenticated users
  - [ ] Loading states during authentication check

### Phase 4: Customer Context UI (Day 2-3)
- [ ] **Customer Switching Interface**
  - [ ] Customer selector dropdown in header
  - [ ] Customer context display (current customer name/ID)
  - [ ] Context switching with proper state reset
  - [ ] Visual indicators for active customer
  - [ ] Permission-based visibility

### Phase 5: Registration & Password Reset (Day 3)
- [ ] **Extended Auth Forms**
  - [ ] User registration form (admin-invited users)
  - [ ] Password reset request form
  - [ ] Password reset confirmation form
  - [ ] Email verification handling
  - [ ] Form validation and error states

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Architecture
- **Base Components**: Build on AppLayout, Header, and form utilities from Task 1.1
- **State Management**: Enhance existing auth-store.ts from Task 1.1
- **Routing**: Integrate with Next.js App Router structure from Task 1.1
- **Styling**: Use TailwindCSS configuration and responsive system from Task 1.1

### API Integration Points
```typescript
// Authentication endpoints (to be implemented by backend team)
POST /api/auth/login        // Email/password + customer selection
POST /api/auth/logout       // JWT invalidation
POST /api/auth/refresh      // Token refresh
GET  /api/auth/me           // Current user + customer context
POST /api/auth/switch       // Customer context switching
```

### Security Considerations
- JWT tokens stored in httpOnly cookies (not localStorage)
- CSRF protection for state-changing operations
- Customer ID validation on every request
- Automatic session timeout and cleanup
- Secure password policies and validation

## Dependencies

### Blocking Dependencies from Task 1.1
- **auth-store.ts**: Zustand authentication store (✅ EXISTS)
- **customer-store.ts**: Customer context management (✅ EXISTS)  
- **AppLayout component**: Header integration point (✅ EXISTS)
- **Container/Grid components**: Form layout utilities (✅ EXISTS)
- **TailwindCSS configuration**: Styling foundation (✅ EXISTS)

### Missing Dependencies from Task 1.1
- **Form validation utilities**: Need to create or use library
- **API client setup**: Service layer for authentication endpoints
- **Error boundary components**: Error handling in authentication flow

## Related Tasks

### Immediate Follow-ups
- **Task 1.3**: Dashboard Framework Foundation (depends on authentication)
- **Task 1.4**: Development Environment Setup (testing integration)
- **Backend Auth API**: FastAPI authentication endpoints (backend developer)

### Integration Points
- **Customer Data Access**: Authentication state must control data visibility
- **Dashboard Context**: Customer switching triggers dashboard data refresh
- **Reporting Access**: Customer permissions determine report availability

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] User can log in with email/password
- [ ] Multi-customer users can select customer context
- [ ] JWT tokens are properly stored and refreshed
- [ ] Protected routes redirect unauthenticated users
- [ ] Customer context persists across page reloads
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile/tablet/desktop

### Technical Requirements  
- [ ] All authentication components have TypeScript interfaces
- [ ] Error states are properly handled and displayed
- [ ] Loading states provide clear user feedback
- [ ] Authentication state is properly managed in Zustand
- [ ] SSR compatibility maintained for Next.js

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for all authentication components
- [ ] Integration tests for login/logout flow
- [ ] Customer switching functionality tests
- [ ] Responsive behavior tests
- [ ] Error handling scenario tests

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
- **Task 1.1 Dependency**: Authentication UI depends on layout components
- **API Coordination**: Backend authentication endpoints must be available
- **Customer Context Complexity**: Multi-tenant switching adds complexity
- **JWT Security**: Proper token handling is critical for security

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Mock API Endpoints**: Create mock authentication API for development
- **Progressive Implementation**: Start with single-customer auth, add multi-tenant
- **Security Review**: Review JWT implementation before production
- **Integration Testing**: Test with realistic customer scenarios

## Implementation Plan

### Day 1: Foundation & Login
- Morning: Enhance auth-store.ts with JWT management
- Afternoon: Create Login form component with validation

### Day 2: Protection & Context
- Morning: Implement ProtectedRoute and route guards
- Afternoon: Build customer context switching UI

### Day 3: Extended Features & Testing
- Morning: Add registration and password reset forms  
- Afternoon: Integration testing and responsive verification

### Success Validation
- **Manual Testing**: Complete authentication flow walkthrough
- **Automated Tests**: All authentication component tests pass
- **Security Review**: JWT implementation review and validation
- **Performance Check**: Authentication state changes don't cause unnecessary re-renders

**IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY**: This task builds incrementally on Task 1.1 foundation, focusing on secure, multi-customer authentication that supports the broader SaaS platform goals.
