        This table provides a record for each FY for each Certification that was in progress at the time, with a completion status for that FY
        For example, a Certification started in FY19 and completed in FY21, there would be 3 records, with only the FY21 having CertificationCompletionStatusForFY='Certified' and the other two years as 'Not certified'
