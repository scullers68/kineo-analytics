/*
        This table provides a record for each FY for each program that was in progress at the time, with a completion status for that FY
        For example, a course started in FY19 and completed in FY21, there would be 3 records, with only the FY21 having ProgramCompletionStatusForFY='Completed' and the other two years as 'In Progress'
*/

-- All the MAX stuff and related grouping here is to get a single record for ewach course_user/year. The reason it is needed is because each course can apply to multiple programs.
