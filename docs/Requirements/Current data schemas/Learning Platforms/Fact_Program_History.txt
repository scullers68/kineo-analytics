/*
        This table provides a record for each FY for each program that was in progress at the time, with a completion status for that FY
        For example, a course started in FY19 and completed in FY21, there would be 3 records, with only the FY21 having ProgramCompletionStatusForFY='Completed' and the other two years as 'In Progress'
