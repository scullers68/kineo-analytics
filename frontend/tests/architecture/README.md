# Task 1.1: React Application Architecture Tests

## Scope (Based on DEVELOPER_A_PHASES.md)

This directory contains **ONLY** the basic tests required for Task 1.1 React Application Architecture as defined in DEVELOPER_A_PHASES.md:

1. ✅ Initialize Next.js 13+ with TypeScript
2. ✅ Configure TailwindCSS and design system  
3. ✅ Set up Zustand for state management
4. ✅ Implement Next.js App Router file-based routing
5. ✅ Create responsive layout components

## Test File

- `task-1-1-basic-architecture.test.ts` - 20 focused tests covering the 5 requirements

## Running Tests

```bash
npm test task-1-1-basic-architecture
```

## Important Note

Previous test files with 104 tests were **over-engineered** and tested features belonging to:
- Task 1.2: Authentication UI Components
- Task 1.3: Dashboard Framework Foundation  
- Task 1.4: Development Environment Setup
- Later optimization tasks

These have been removed to maintain clear scope boundaries and prevent implementation theater.

## Task Status

**Task 1.1 is COMPLETE** - All 5 requirements are implemented and working.
